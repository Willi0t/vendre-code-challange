# Vendre code challange
I was given a task to design a responsive employees' page in one week. I was provided with an API to work with from reqres.in. The data from the API did not include titles, so I added that to the object in the frontend. That would make the components more realistic in terms of how the logic would have been if the data were included.

The website has a few elements that were taken from Vendre's website to make the employees' page fit as if it was made for them. The NavBar component and Footer are recreated from their own. The footer also includes a copyright mark: "Copyright 춸 2023 Vendre". This page does not have a copyright. It is simply there to look like the real page.

The page also has pages, per request from Vendre. This makes the interaction for mobile feel a bit clunky. If I were to redo it, I would skip the pages for mobile and just have a straight flow from top to bottom. However, due to time constraints, I only made one version of the app.

#Additional info
The navbar component has multiple pages, but since my task was to create one page, they are just routed to a 404 page. They are there to make the design look realistic and have no function.

the 404page art work is borrowed from Halvor Nordrum.

The icons in the cards have a similar function. They are set to go to LinkedIn and GitHub, but they will return a 404 page since the users are not real.
